                            <p>Several appliances make kitchen and culinary activities easier and faster. Ovens 
                            are one of the most vital appliances in every kitchen. The average homeowner wants 
                            their oven in good condition to ensure tasty, fully-cooked meals. Often, this means 
                            having to stay on top of common oven problems.<br/><br/>

                            There are different faults your oven can develop. Some faults have DIY fixes, 
                            and others may require you to hire a professional for repair. Here, we’ll not only 
                            familiarize you with possible faults that may hamper your oven’s workings. 
                            But we’ll also explain what to do when your oven stops working.<br/><br/>
                                
                            So, let’s get into ten common oven problems and how to fix them. </p>

                        <h3>Oven Not Heating to Appropriate Temperature</h3>
                        <div class="descr-refr-repair">
                            <p>Several reasons could be responsible for this problem. But usually, the gas igniter, heating element or temperature sensor is the guilty component. Fortunately, you can run a quick diagnosis to detect where the fault lies.

                            Start by checking the temperature sensor to ascertain it isn’t in contact with the interior wall of your oven. Furthermore, confirm with an ohmmeter if the sensor is working. An unresponsive sensor may require you to replace it.
                                
                            Meanwhile, the sensor may not be the problem. So, you’ll need to examine the oven further. Therefore, the next place to check is the gas igniter or heating element to ensure it’s fault-free.
                                
                            There may be a need for oven recalibration if you have to replace any of the above parts. Fortunately, you can recalibrate your oven by yourself too. Simply carry out the process by heating your oven to 350°F. Please note that you’ll need an oven thermometer while recalibrating your range.
                                
                            That said, use an oven thermometer to check the temperature of your oven after twenty minutes of heating at 350°F. You’ll need to repeat this check every twenty minutes for about two hours. Also, kindly note the temperature scales of each check.
                                
                            Afterwards, sum up each temperature check reading and divide the result by the total number of checks. This way, you’ll be able to know the average oven temperature. At this stage, you may adjust the temperature if you feel the need. </p>

                        <div class="descr-refr-repair">
                            <p>Most modern ovens have self-cleaning features. However, this feature may seem absent sometimes. Luckily, there are ways to diagnose why it may not be working.

                            Firstly, you need to follow the instructions for self-cleaning your oven correctly. Also, you need to understand that an oven will hardly self-clean if the debris is in significant quantity. Thus, you may sometimes need to resort to manual sanitation for your oven.
                                
                            Usually, your oven should continue self-cleaning after carrying out a manual cleaning. But there are some exceptions to this assertion. For example, your oven may still not self-clean despite manual cleaning.
                                
                            This setback may mean replacing your thermostat, control board, or other oven components. As such, you may require the help of a technician. They’ll help you diagnose what’s stopping your oven from self-cleaning.</p>

                        <div class="descr-refr-repair">
                            <p>This heading shows one of the most common oven problems you can encounter. For it, we have an easy fix for your oven.

                            Have you been noticing that your food looks and tastes well-done on one side and half-done on another side? These could be signs of some faulty components of your oven. It means heating isn’t even in the oven interior.
                                
                            Examples of things that could be faulty in a gas oven, in this case, include the igniter and thermostat. For electric ovens, the heating element and thermostat are usually faulty in this case. So now let’s see how to fix this oven problem.
                                
                            Simply fix this problem by preheating your oven and checking if its heat elements come up. For example, a gas oven would usually ignite, and an electric oven will typically light up. Afterwards, check the oven temperature in an equation to the temperature sensor.
                                
                            Sometimes, DIY methods may not solve your oven’s problem. Thus, the best way to fix oven problems in such instances is to replace faulty components. For this issue, simply replace the thermostat and heating elements if you’re using an electric oven. Or replace the igniter and thermostat if you use gas ovens.
                                
                            The inability of heat to permeate and circulate can cause your food not to cook well. Therefore, try to clean utensils like trays that you permanently use and keep in the oven. An overly messy tray may not allow heat to bounce off them due to the thick stain on their reflection.</p>

                        <div class="descr-refr-repair">
                            <p>This malfunction is one of the most common oven problems. Usually, gas ovens have ignitions that trigger fire to the burners. However, they may sometimes go cold, especially if you don’t use them for a while.

                            Fortunately, there’s an easy fix for your oven if you’re in this situation. Firstly, remove the burner grate, base, and cap. Then, cleanse the burner of food particles with any available cloth or vacuum. Don’t forget to pay attention to the case and grate too.
                                
                            Afterwards, examine the wiring between the igniter and the control module. Here, you may notice that the wires are loose. If so, simply tighten them and try to light up your burner.
                                
                            Possibly, the burner may remain dead after trying the solutions given. This issue signifies a need to replace your igniter. Also, another reason the burner may not come up is a faulty gas line. This fault is one of the common oven repair issues that require the services of an oven repair technician.</p>

                            <p>A faulty control board is well known among the common oven problems. It can be a tad difficult for the average homeowner to detect a faulty control board. But, there’s a way to determine if the control board is the problem when your oven stops working.

                            The control board is likely faulty if your oven sensor tests okay. Additionally, you can check for burn signs or shortenings to be sure. However, it’s best to engage oven repair services in Ontario to get your oven’s proper diagnosis. This resolve is the best way to fix your dicey oven problems.</p>

                        <h3>Oven Interior Light Off</h3>
                        <div class="descr-refr-repair">
                            <p>This fault is a common oven problem with lethal possibilities. Oven lights help illuminate your oven interior. But, the bulbs in them can wear out quickly and unexpectedly. So, you may want to use your phone lamp as a substitute for your dead oven lights.

                            This practice is hazardous. It can cause an explosion, especially if you’re using a gas oven. Therefore, it’s important to change the light bulbs as soon as possible.
                                
                            Replacing the light bulbs is pretty straightforward. Firstly put on rubber gloves before you start handling the bulbs. This safety measure prevents pricks if the old or new bulb breaks during handling.
                                
                            Afterwards, lift the bulb shade by turning it counter-clockwise. After that, unhook the old bulb and affix a new one. </p>

                            <p>A nonfunctional thermal fuse is the same as an oven not working. It’s a top issue among common oven problems.

                            The usual cause of thermal fuse damage is overheating of the oven. In most cases, the thermal fuse gives a light-blowing sound. Once blown, the oven’s power immediately shuts down.
                                
                            With a multimeter, you can first test the fuse to ascertain no continuity. Endeavour to change the fuse once you confirm there’s no continuity. </p>

                        <h3>Oven Door Not Closing</h3>
                        <div class="descr-refr-repair">
                            <p>You know the way your air-conditioner is practically useless if all the doors and windows are open? That’s how your oven is almost of no use when it’s not closing or shutting. But there are easy troubleshooting steps for when you’re in this situation.

                            First, unplug from power if you own an electric oven. Next, disconnect from the gas source if It’s a gas oven. Afterwards, detach the oven door by slightly jacking it up and pulling it out.
                                
                            Usually, most oven models have screws holding the doors to their bases. However, there are some ovens that you only need to unlatch straps to detach their doors completely. Regardless, check for loose hinges or straps to know if you’re working towards replacements or simple tightenings.
                                
                            Similarly, check for broken or bent door springs for repair or replacements as necessary. You can use pliers to get rid of broken springs, straighten crooked ones, and attach new ones.
                                
                            Importantly, ensure you wring the tips of the springs around two string bolts during replacements. Meanwhile, you may need to replace the rubber gasket that’s usually around the door.
                                
                            The oven door not closing when you tick the above boxes indicates a bigger problem. Most likely, you’ll need to replace the door sensor.</p>
