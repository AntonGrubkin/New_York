                            <p>Your refrigerator provides ample storage space for fresh foods and frozen items alike, offering 
                                the ingredients you need to create beloved meals and delicious new dishes for family and friends. 
                                A properly functioning refrigerator is a staple in any kitchen, but like any other home appliance, 
                                you may have problems with your refrigerator that require repairs.<br/><br/>
    
                                There are a variety of common refrigerator problems that are best resolved by professional 
                                appliance repairmen. To help you diagnose your refrigerator problems, we’re covering some of 
                                the most common refrigerator repair problems.</p>

                        <h3>Refrigerator Is Constantly Cycling Or Running</h3>
                        <div class="descr-refr-repair">
                            <p>One of the most common refrigerator problems is a unit that cycles, or runs, too frequently. Your 
                            refrigerator needs to run in order to maintain cool temperatures for food, and a refrigerator that 
                            constantly runs can be very noisy. Even worse, it will significantly increase your energy bill, as 
                            the refrigerator is one of the most power-intensive appliances in any home.<br/><br/>

                            The most common cause of a refrigerator running too much is buildup of dust or other kitchen 
                            debris around the unit’s condenser coils. To check this, you should cut power to your 
                            refrigerator and access the coils, which are commonly on the bottom of the unit.<br/><br/>
                                
                            If the problem persists after cleaning, your refrigerator’s temperature may be set too low, 
                            causing it to run constantly to maintain a very low temperature. Try adjusting your 
                            refrigerator’s temperature to see if this impacts the cycling. Consider consulting a 
                            professional refrigerator repairman if problems persist.</p>

                        <h3>Refrigerator Leaks Water</h3>
                        <div class="descr-refr-repair">
                            <p>Water leakage is a common but alarming refrigerator problem. This issue is often caused by a blocked defrost drain, 
                            or a clogged or frozen water supply line.<br/><br/>

                            Your unit’s defrost drain can be blocked by food particles or other debris, and is typically accessible from inside 
                            your freezer. You can try to flush the drain from inside the freezer using warm water, though you may need to remove 
                            debris manually. Locate the defrost drain hose on the back of your refrigerator, and clean it with hot water and soap 
                            to remove any clogged debris.<br/><br/>
                                
                            Should you suspect your refrigerator’s water supply line is clogged or frozen, you should unplug the appliance and 
                            make sure its shut-off valve is closed. From there, examine the water supply line to see if there are any breaks or 
                            tears. If so, the line should be replaced. If you notice a clog that does not appear to be ice, consult with a 
                            refrigerator repair professional.</p>

                        <div class="descr-refr-repair">
                            <p>Your refrigerator’s freezer is the perfect storage space for ice, but it shouldn’t contain significant ice buildup.

                            Leaving the freezer open for too long could cause ice buildup, as this raises the humidity level inside the freezer. Be sure to close your freezer door when you’ve finished accessing the unit to ensure humidity levels do not rise too much. Your freezer may also have a faulty seal, which lets in outside air to raise humidity. You can replace your freezer’s seal to ensure it holds the proper temperatures and humidity levels.
                                
                            Enlist assistance from a professional refrigerator repair service if these solutions do not solve your problem.</p>

                        <div class="descr-refr-repair">
                            <p>Many modern refrigerators feature a built-in water dispenser, providing your home with cold and fresh water with ease. Your unit’s water dispenser may not work for a variety of reasons.

                            The water tub in your unit’s freezer door may be frozen, blocking fresh water from flowing through the dispenser. Luckily, this tub can be disconnected and thawed, allowing water to flow once again. You may also have a defective water inlet valve. The water inlet valve opens to supply the dispenser with water, but may be broken. You may also have low water pressure, meaning that water is not being pushed through the inlet valve for the dispenser. If you have difficulty solving this issue, consider contacting a professional refrigerator repair technician.</p>

                            <p>Refrigerators are designed to stay cold, making excessive heat from your unit particularly alarming. If you notice your refrigerator is warm, you’ll definitely need to complete repairs fast.

                            A warm refrigerator is likely caused by problems with its condenser coils. You can start by cleaning the refrigerator’s condenser coils, while also checking the condenser fan motor to ensure it is running properly. This problem can be particularly difficult to solve, and often requires professional refrigerator repair services to fix.</p>

                            <p>The refrigerator should operate at a volume that does not intrude on your daily life. If your refrigerator seems particularly noisy, you probably have a problem with one of its fans.

                            Most common refrigerators feature both a condenser fan and an evaporator fan. The condenser fan cools your unit’s condenser coil. Meanwhile, the evaporator fan pulls air over the freezer’s evaporator coils while the compressor is running. These fans run at the same time, and issues with either one of their motors can make your refrigerator significantly louder. You can inspect these fans to see if their motors appear to be broken, just be sure to unplug your refrigerator before inspection.</p>

                        <div class="descr-refr-repair">
                            <p>If you notice a sudden increase in your home’s energy bill, there may be a problem with your refrigerator. Remember, the refrigerator is one of the most energy-intensive appliances in any home, and its operation can significantly impact your home’s total energy use.

                            You can use a Kill A Watt energy usage meter to measure your refrigerator’s energy use, and compare that to its manufacturer specifications. Should your refrigerator use significantly more energy than it’s supposed to, it may be the cause of your increased bills. This is common with old units that must work hard to maintain cold temperatures. Though professional repairs may alleviate this problem, it’s often best to replace an out-of-date refrigerator with a newer unit.
